* Grammaticus

This Emacs package helps with composing text in the Latin language
by displaying information from the built-in database of the excellent
[[https://github.com/Alatius/latin-macronizer/][latin-macronizer]]
by Johan Winge.

Looking up information about the word '/arās/', for example,
yields the following in the echo area:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*ărās*: verb, 2nd person singular present indicative active (aro) \\
ārās: noun, plural feminine accusative (ara)
#+END_QUOTE
Bold words are considered exact matches, but
near matches with different vowel lengths are also shown.

** Usage

First execute the ~package-install-file~ command and
point it to a local copy of ~grammaticus.el~ from this repository,
then ~grammaticus-add-words~ and
point it to a copy of ~macrons.txt~, which you can download at
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alatius/latin-macronizer/master/macrons.txt.

There are two ways to use this package:
Either explicitly look up words with ~grammaticus-lookup~,
or simply activate ~grammaticus-mode~,
which automatically looks up the word at point.

Note that if you want to
explicitly look up words at point by pressing a key,
you have to wrap ~grammaticus-lookup~ like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(bind-key [f9] (lambda () (interactive) (grammaticus-lookup)))
#+END_SRC

You can customize ~grammaticus-use-J~ and ~grammaticus-use-V~
if you prefer, say, '/adiuuat/' over '/adjuvat/'.
